- Fixed multicast receiving problem
- Got SSH remote automated testing for data sending, receiving, universe synchronisation, universe discovery and this all passes
- Check receiving and it works for data from a commercial in use source (a real lighting board).
- User acceptance tests (someone other than the person who is in the email preferably).
- Document the code by creating a man page for how to use the library
	- Also need the regular comments
	- Find the documentation for another implementation and then have a table in the report which shows the pages that the documentation has, 
	- the pages that my documentation has (lined up), and how complete my pages are (how many levels of the API in the other implementation 
	- are covered by my implementation)
- Licensing for after project is submitted / release - all the files should have the licensing at the top (apache etc...) aswell as acknowledgement of the university
- Cannot make public until after results have come back, make sure there is a clean seperation (e.g. with a fork) between stuff that was done here and stuff that was 
  done later if I was to go back and modify the library.
- In the report make clear what was already existing and what has been added, git can show the changes since the initial fork, this should be in the appendix and 
  ideally be visual e.g a timeline of changes.
