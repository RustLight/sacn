    /// - The source name may be the same across multiple universes sourced by the same component:
    /// - The source name should be unique: Left to the implementer / user-configuration
/// 6.2.3 E1.31 Data Packet: Priority
    /// - The most recent E1.31 Data Packet from a single source must supersede any previous packet
    ///     from that source:
    /// - A receiver may receiver data for the same universe from multiple sources which is distinguished by examining
    ///     the CID in the packet:
    /// - The priority field must be in the range 0 to 200
    /// - Data from sources with a higher priority (e.g. 200 vs 100) will be treated as the defininive data for that universe.
    /// - If the E1.31 receiver is also doing universe syncronisation then the behaviour is undefined:
/// 6.2.3.1 Multiple Sources at Highest Priority
    /// - If there are multiple sources transmitting data at the same highest currently active priority for a given
    ///     universe then this must be handled:
    /// - If a receiver is only capable of processing a certain number of sources of data it will encounter a sources exceeded
    ///     condition when a greater number of sources are present:
/// 6.2.3.2 Note on Merge and Arbitration Algorithms
    /// - Allow various merging algorithms for combining data from multiple sources:
/// 6.2.3.3 Note on Resolution of Sources Exceeded Condition
    /// - Various possible resolution mechanisms shouldbe possible:
    /// - Resolution mechanisms are recommended to not generate different results from the same 
    ///     source combination on different occasions as it can make troubleshooting more difficult:
/// 6.2.3.4 Requirements for Merging and Arbitrating
    /// - The ability to merge/arbitrate between multiple sources, the maximum number of sources which
    ///     can be handled and the algorithm used should all be declared in user documentation for the device: Left to the implementer
/// 6.2.3.5 Requirements for Sources Exceeded Resolution
    /// - The resolution behaviour for equipment to resolve a source exceeded condition should be specified in the user documentation:
    /// - The sources exceeded condition is highly recommended to be easily detected at the device aswell as potentially through the network:
/// 6.2.3.6 Requirements for Devices with Multiple Operating Modes
    /// - All different operating modes for a device should be compliant with the standard or or non-compliant configurations should be 
    ///     clearly declared as such.
