Draft report (with what has been done so far) - End S1
Finished draft report - 1 month before final submission
Finaling report - 2 weeks before final submission
Submit - 1 week before deadline

Primary Objectives
1. Learn rust - Throughout the project development
2. Establish the extends of the existing implementation and introduce more thorough testing to verify its correctness(fixing issues found). - End S1
3. Expand the existing implementation to allow receiving DMX through sACN. - Before ILW
4. Expand the existing implementation to allow sending DMX with universe synchronisation. - End ILW
5. Expand the existing implementation to allow universe discovery. - End S1

Justification for 2. being after 3. and 4. is not sure how much will be needed for the universe synchronisation and discovery as some of it exists already.

Secondary Objectives

1. Analyse the performance of this protocol implementation verses other implementations in different languages using a number of different metrics. - 1 month before final submission.
2. Analyse the performance of this protocol in various implementations verses another protocol such as ArtNet[7]. - 1 month before final submission.
3. Test the completed implementation in a real-world environment by creating a demo program which utilises the library. - 3 weeks before final submission.
4. Window and Unix support. - Semester 2 Week 4
5. Introduce unicast and broadcast support. - Semester 2 Week 2
6. Ipv4 and Ipv6 support - TBD
