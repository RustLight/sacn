\title{CS4099 DOER: Rust implementation of the sACN protocol}
\begin{document}
	\maketitle
\section*{Description}
	The project aims to expand an existing implementation \cite{ORIGNIAL_IMPL} of the streaming architecture for control networks (sACN) protocol \cite{ANSI_E1.17} in rust so that it fulfils the scope of the protocol as defined in \cite{ANSI_E1.31}.\\
	
\subsection*{Background}
\subsubsection*{DMX512} DMX512 is an protocol used in the entertainment industry for the control of lighting, effects and other devices. It works by daisy chaining devices together into distinct physical chains (called universes) and is a one way protocol. This means that the devices in the line cannot communicate their presence back to the controller so the controller must know about the devices ahead of time and their addresses so it can broadcast packets down the line which the devices then receive and use. The DMX packets are a fixed size and contain five hundred and twelve 8-byte channel (+ a start code) which allows them to control up to 512 different devices on a singular line. A device may support the use of multiple channels to control different functionalities so for example a light with RGB colour mixing may use 3 channels to allow control of the Red, Green and Blue individually. Since there are only 512 channels available on a single universe this quickly imposes a limitation to the number of devices that can be connected together, especially as modern lighting fixtures commonly use upwards of 30 channels each for a moving light with usage of many more not uncommon. The solution to this was previously to simply have more physical lines (universes) and in this way allow more devices to be controlled simultaneously. This comes with a number of problems however as each new physical line means a new cable coming directly from the control desk.

\paragraph*{DMX512 Problems}
\begin{list}{}{}
	\item As the control desk is often far from the devices themselves (at the back of the venue whereas the lights/devices are above the stage) it means that many cables need to be run which can be expensive and time consuming.
	\item The length of the cable runs can cause signal interference / degradation and DMX as a 1 way protocol does not have any error correction (bad frames if detected are thrown out).
	\item The protocol only allowing 512 channels per physical line means that a device cannot have more channels than this. This is particularly a problem recently with the advent of complex fixtures which may have many LED's with individual colour control.
\end{list}

\subsubsection*{sACN}
One solution to solve some of the problems with DMX is to send it using UDP over a standard IP based network and one of the protocols created to do this is sACN. This allows many DMX packets (and so many universes) to be simultaneously sent using a single network cable from the console and then to be split up and received by

 It
generally consists of about two pages of text and must include these four sections:
Description
The title and a short description of the project aims,
context and background. It should explain the big
picture of what you would like to achieve, why it is
important, and how you intend to go about doing it (e.g.
by using some kind of technology or developing a new
algorithm, or following a particular methodology, etc.)

Objectives
This is a list of clearly defined, measurable goals you
intend to achieve by the end of your project. This could
include any software artefacts you intend to submit in
the end, results of an evaluation (for surveys or research
algorithms), etc. Your performance will be measured
against these objectives.
Typically, you will list about 3-5 primary objectives
which are necessary for a project to be deemed
successful, and further 3 or so secondary objectives
which allow a successful project to be extended in an
interesting direction. Occasionally, tertiary objectives
may also be listed, but these are comparatively rare.
Ethics
Here you should discuss any ethical considerations
pertaining to your project. Start with the selfassessment form from the Student Handbook (Ethics
section). If you can answer “No” to all questions on the
self-assessment form, this section of the DOER
document will be brief and state that there are no ethical
considerations.
If you are planning to work with people (especially
children), animals, sensitive private data, or if there are
other considerations, you should discuss them here, and
explain how you went about obtaining necessary
approval (any Ethics applications).
The self-assessment form and any other relevant
documents (if applicable) should be scanned and
uploaded to the “Ethics” slot on MMS.

Resources
This is a list of any special resources your project will
need: hardware, software, licenses, access to
infrastructure (e.g. compute servers), drones, etc. Think
ahead, but be realistic -- the School will not be able to
fulfill all requests.
Most projects can be completed using standard school
equipment, in which case this section will contain only a
short statement confirming this.
You and your supervisor will have to agree on everything in the DOER document.
Typically, the process looks like this:
1. Schedule a meeting with the supervisor to flesh out the description,
objectives, and any needed resources,
2. Write this all up in a word processor, following the structure presented
above,
3. Make sure both you and the supervisor agree about the contents (via email
or in person),
4. Submit the DOER to MMS.
