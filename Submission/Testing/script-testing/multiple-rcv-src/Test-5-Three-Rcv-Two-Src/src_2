# Send sync packet to universe 101 to trigger the data packet sent to universe 101 and 102 (after a small wait). This is repeated multiple times because receiver 3 must
# join and listen to syncronisation address 101 when it receives the data packets above with 101 as the syncronisation address. This means it is liable to miss the first
# few sync packets so this is repeated to ensure it is received.
